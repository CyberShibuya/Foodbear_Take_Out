Foodbear is an online food ordering application that facilitates seamless food orders for customers and empowers managers with efficient food management tools. Developed in Java, making use of JDK 8, the project harnesses the power of Spring Boot and Mybatis Plus. The database backbone is MySQL, reinforced by Redis to optimize queries through effective caching strategies.
